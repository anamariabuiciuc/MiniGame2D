# MiniGame2D
# "Fereste-te de fantoma!" is a 2D mini game created with C ++ and OpenGL. The main character, Patratel, is scared and avoids the ghost, called Casper. 
# All we have to do is help him avoid it every time he appears in front of her. Careful! The more we avoid the ghost, the more he gets angry and increases
# his speed towards the Square. We hope he doesn't eat it!
